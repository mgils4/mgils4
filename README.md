 # üí´ About Me:
Hi! I am a novice bioinformation eager to learn!
- üî≠ I'm currently working on some small scale automatic bioinformatic analysis stuff. 
- üå± I am currently learning / want to start learning some Javascript for minor projects, and I am planning to get into NextFlow and R
- üí¨ Ask me about data analysis and visualisation, mainly in biology / sequencing related science!

While reposities are currently private, I have some experience in Python and creating Snakemake based pipelines for interpretation and processing of Nanopore sequencing data.
